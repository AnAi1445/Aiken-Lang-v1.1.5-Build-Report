Key Features and Enhancements in v1.1.5

8. Improved NFT Support:

Aiken now has stronger built-in support for handling NFTs with native Cardano tokens. The standard library includes better functions for minting, listing, and transferring NFTs.
The Map and List modules have been improved to support more efficient indexing and searching, which is especially useful for NFT marketplaces.

9. New and Updated Modules:
    
-Data.Map: Optimized for faster lookups and updates, which is crucial for implementing marketplaces and managing user balances or item listings.

-Data.String and Data.Bool: These foundational types are now better integrated with new features for condition-based execution in contracts (such as NFT availability, marketplace bids, etc.).


10. Bug Fixes:
    
-Error Handling: Several issues with unhelpful error messages and silent failures were addressed. For example, failed data lookups in maps now provide clearer feedback.
-Concurrency Bugs: Several concurrency-related bugs, especially in contracts that require atomic operations (e.g., auctions), were fixed.
-Memory Management: Optimizations in memory handling for contracts interacting with larger datasets have improved contract performance, particularly in high-volume environments.
-Event Emission:
The event emission system now logs events more reliably, allowing external systems to better interact with the contractâ€™s state changes (e.g., an NFT sale or a new listing).

11. Common Bugs and Issues in Aiken-Lang v1.1.5

While Aiken v1.1.5 offers significant improvements, there are still a few known issues:

-Pattern Matching Failures:
Some pattern matching operations may fail or lead to runtime errors when the expected data structure is not found, especially when working with dynamic maps (e.g., marketplace item lookup). Example:
...
case Map.lookup nftId marketplace of
    Some nft -> ...  // works
    None -> ...  // may cause unexpected behavior

...
12. Event Logging Delays:

Event logs are sometimes delayed or may not be recorded in real-time, which can be problematic for applications relying on immediate feedback for UI updates or off-chain actions.

13. Transaction Delays:

While the system supports transaction execution, there have been reports of delays when multiple users interact with the same smart contract (e.g., multiple bids on the same NFT). This is particularly relevant for contracts that need to process multiple transactions in quick succession.

14. Inconsistent Serialization:
Issues with serializing complex data structures in certain environments, especially when interacting with off-chain applications or external oracles.
