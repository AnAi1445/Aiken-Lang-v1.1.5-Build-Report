### Key Features and Enhancements in v1.1.5

1. Improved NFT Support

Aiken now has stronger built-in support for handling NFTs with native Cardano tokens. The standard library includes better functions for minting, listing, and transferring NFTs.
The Map and List modules have been improved to support more efficient indexing and searching, which is especially useful for NFT marketplaces.

2. New and Updated Modules:
    
-Data.Map: Optimized for faster lookups and updates, which is crucial for implementing marketplaces and managing user balances or item listings.

-Data.String and Data.Bool: These foundational types are now better integrated with new features for condition-based execution in contracts (such as NFT availability, marketplace bids, etc.).


3. Bug Fixes:
-Error Handling: Several issues with unhelpful error messages and silent failures were addressed. For example, failed data lookups in maps now provide clearer feedback.
-Concurrency Bugs: Several concurrency-related bugs, especially in contracts that require atomic operations (e.g., auctions), were fixed.
Memory Management: Optimizations in memory handling for contracts interacting with larger datasets have improved contract performance, --particularly in high-volume environments.

4. Event Emission:
The event emission system now logs events more reliably, allowing external systems to better interact with the contractâ€™s state changes (e.g., an NFT sale or a new listing).
